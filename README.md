This project investigates the crucial link between air quality and public health in urban environments.  We're diving deep into the data to uncover how air pollution (PM2.5, NO2, O3, and more) might be affecting respiratory health outcomes like hospital admissions and asthma rates. ü´Å  Our goal is to provide data-driven insights that can inform policy and improve lives. üåç

## Project Goal üéØ

To investigate the correlation between air quality metrics (e.g., PM2.5, NO2, O3) and public health outcomes (e.g., respiratory hospital admissions, asthma rates) in a specific urban area.  We'll aim to identify pollution hotspots and vulnerable populations, providing data-driven insights for policy recommendations.

## Data Sources (Conceptual - Using Synthetic Data) üß™

This project uses *synthetic* data for demonstration and reproducibility.  This means we're simulating realistic data, which avoids the complexities and ethical considerations of using real-world, potentially sensitive health data.  In a real-world application, you would use the following *types* of data sources, with appropriate approvals and privacy safeguards:

*   **Air Quality Data:** Hourly or daily readings of pollutants from monitoring stations.  Think EPA, local government environmental agencies, or open data portals.  *Our simulation generates realistic daily values.*
*   **Public Health Data:** Aggregated, *anonymized* data on hospital admissions for respiratory illnesses, asthma prevalence rates, etc.  Sources could include public health agencies or research datasets.  *Our simulation creates correlated, but anonymized, health metrics.*  **Crucially, we'd *never* use individual-level patient data in a real-world project like this without proper ethical approvals and anonymization procedures.**
*   **Demographic Data (Optional):** Census data or similar to explore correlations with socioeconomic factors (e.g., income, age, population density).  This can help identify vulnerable populations.  *We could add a simulation for this later.*
*   **Geospatial Data (Optional):** Shapefiles or GeoJSON data of the city, neighborhoods, and locations of monitoring stations.  This would allow for creating insightful maps. *We could add a simulation for this later.*


## How to Run üöÄ

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>  # Replace with your repository URL
    cd air_quality_health_impact
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Generate and Preprocess Data:**  This creates the synthetic data and prepares it for analysis.
    ```bash
    python src/data_preprocessing.py
    ```

4.  **Run the Analysis Script:** This performs EDA, Regression and prints the result with visualization
    ```bash
    python src/analysis.py
    ```

5.  **Explore Interactively (Jupyter Notebooks):**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Or
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
    Then, open the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory and run the cells step-by-step.  This is the best way to explore the data and analysis interactively.

## Analysis Components üî¨

*   **Data Preprocessing:**
    *   Generates synthetic air quality and health data.
    *   Cleans the data (handles missing values, ensures correct data types).
    *   Merges the air quality and health data into a single DataFrame.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    *   Calculates descriptive statistics.
    *   Creates histograms to visualize data distributions.
    *   Generates a correlation matrix to identify relationships between variables.
    *   Produces time series plots to visualize trends over time.
    *   Creates scatter plots to explore relationships between specific variables (e.g., PM2.5 vs. hospital admissions).
*   **Regression Analysis:**
    *   Performs linear regression to model the relationship between air pollutants and hospital admissions.
    *   Evaluates the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
    *   Identifies the most important features (pollutants) based on the regression coefficients.
    *   Includes residual plots and actual vs. predicted plots for model diagnostics.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

*   **Python:** The primary programming language.
*   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
*   **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
*   **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning (linear regression).
*   **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive exploration and reporting.
